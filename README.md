##Overview
Logcat is a log analyzation platform. It's not only for log files, but also for all structed text files.  
Logcat makes index for all files, and enables you search logs in a way like using SQL( count(),sum()... from... where ).  
This version uses swoole to speed up by costing more momery and CPU. If you mind it, checkout branch sapi.( Branch sapi is stoped because the plugin system is different ).

##Requirement
[swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src)( Needs cygwin or BashOnWindows in windows )

##Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/questionlin/logcat.git
```
Logcat contains a demo data. If you only want to see the demo, skip this part.  
Change the configuration in config.json  
[click here](https://github.com/questionlin/logcat/blob/master/docs/config.md) to see the explaination.  
Put the log files in subfolders in data/  
It doesn't matter how many subfolders it has.

##Usage
Type the following code to make index for the first time. It may cost some time.
```shell
php index.php &
```
You can use it by open a broswer and typeing 127.0.0.1:8080.

##Performance
PHP version：5.5  
CPU：2.7GHz I5  
log files：22 files, 2.56G totally  
making index costs: 283sec  
one full search costs：10sec  
( excluding compiling time, full search costs 16sec in single process, PHP7 is much faster )

##Debug
If the logformat is wrong, it will write wrong lines in data/error.log.  
I advise to put one line of logs and test before put whole log file in data/.

##Collect log
If you can't put log files in data/, or there are more than one log source, you need log collection.  
Change configuration in config.json, copy whole program to the machine making log files, and then type
```shell
php collector.php &
```
Logcat will collect log automatically.

##Plugin
The main part of Logcat concentrates on making index and filter logs, leaves other parts to plugins.
